# NeuralNavigation
📚 **Project Overview** 

NeuralNavigationSystem simulates adaptive neural pathways inspired by neuroplasticity. It models cognitive decision-making using graph-based learning algorithms and Hebbian principles, inspired by the way neurons in the brain strengthen connections through repeated activation. This project bridges cognitive neuroscience and AI, exploring how human-like decision processes can be achieved with adaptive pathfinding.

🚀 **Key Features**

Adaptive Decision Pathways: Models dynamic decision-making using neuro-inspired weights.

Hebbian Learning: Implements the principle of "Neurons that fire together wire together."

Neuroplasticity Simulation: Simulates synaptic strengthening and decay for adaptive learning.

Visual Network Simulation: Visualizes neural pathways and synaptic changes in real-time using Matplotlib.

⚙️ **Technologies Used**

Python – Core programming language.

NetworkX – Graph modeling and adaptive pathfinding.

Matplotlib – Visualization of neural pathways and decision processes.
